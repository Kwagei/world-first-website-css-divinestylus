                <p>A <a href="">W3</a> server, like the ftp <a href="">daemon</a> , is a program which responds to an incoming tcp connection 
                and provides a service to the caller.There are many varieties of W3 server software to serve different forms of data.</p>
            <h3>The basic daemon</h3>
                <p>The basic W3 daemon program serves files already in hypertext or plain text. This daemon then is used as a basis for many 
                other types of server and gateway. Documentation includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="">User guide</a> .</li>
                    <li><a href="">Internals</a>-- a description of the code.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Much of the above may also apply in whole or part to other servers mentioned below. Whatever server you are running, 
                you will probably be interested in:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
            <h3>Making a new server</h3>
                <p>This daemon is often used as a basis for a more specific server for a given application. A server which allows a world of 
                data to be seen as part of the W3 universe is known as a gateway. (Most servers could therefore be regarded as gateways,
                but the term implies some conversion or mapping between dissimilar worlds) . For short tutorials with examples, see:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="">Writing a server in C</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">Writing a server as a script</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is a good idea to pick the basic daemon or one of the servers below as a starting point when making a new server.</p>
            <h3>Other servers and Gateways</h3>
                <p>These are servers which provide data extracted from other systems. they are built using code from the basic daemon, or scripts.</p>
        
                <span><a href="">FIND gateway</a></span>
                <p>for CERN/VM XFIND which calls a REXX exec to get the information from the XFIND system running on the CERNVM mainframe.</p>
                <span><a href="">VMS Help gateway</a></span>
                <p>This allows any VMS help files to be made available to WWW clients. Runs on VAX/VMS.</p>
                <span><a href="">WAISGate</a></span>
                <p>A gateway to information available using the W.A.I.S. protocol.</p>
                <span><a href="">DCLServer</a></span>
                <p>A server for VMS systems which allows you to write a gateway to your own favorite information system using DCL.</p>
                <span><a href="">System33</a></span>
                <p>A (big) csh script server providing data including Xerox System33 documents, man pages in plain text, phone numbers, etc. etc...!</p>
                <span><a href="">Oracle</a></span>
                <p>A generic server to oracle. Could be used as a basis for gateways to specific Oracle databases.</p>
                <span><a href="">Geography</a></span>
                <p>Gateway to the</p>
                <p>Geography server at U Michigan</p>
